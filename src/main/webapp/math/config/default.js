  //  A comma-separated list of configuration files to load

  //  A comma-separated list of CSS stylesheet files to be loaded

  //  Example:    styleSheets: ["MathJax.css"],

  styleSheets: [],

  //  Styles to be defined dynamically at startup time.
  //  
  //  Example:

  //          color: "#888"
  //        }
  //      },

  //
  //  A comma-separated list of input and output jax to initialize at startup.
  //  Their main code is loaded only when they are actually used, so it is not
  //  inefficient to include jax that may not actually be used on the page.  These
  //  are found in the MathJax/jax directory.  The choices include
  //  
  //      input/TeX
  //      input/MathML
  //      input/AsciiMath
  //      
  //      output/HTML-CSS
  //      output/NativeMML
  //      output/SVG
  // 
  //   If you change the input jax, you may need to include the appropriate
  //   preprocessor in the extensions array below.
  //  
  jax: ["input/TeX", "output/HTML-CSS"],
  
  //
  //  A comma-separated list of extensions to load at startup.  The default
  //  directory is MathJax/extensions.
  //  
  //  Example:    extensions: ["tex2jax.js","TeX/AMSmath.js","TeX/AMSsymbols.js"],
  //  
  //  You may wish to include "mml2jax.js" if you are using "input/MathML" in the
  //  jax array above, and "asciimath2jax.js" if you using "input/AsciiMath".
  //  Include "jsmath2jax.js" if you are converting from using jsMath to MathJax.
  //
  extensions: ["tex2jax.js"],
  
  //
  //  Patterns to remove from before and after math script tags.  If you are not
  //  using one of the preprocessors (e.g., tex2jax), you need to insert something
  //  extra into your HTML file in order to avoid a bug in Internet Explorer.  IE
  //  removes spaces from the DOM that it thinks are redundent, and since a SCRIPT
  //  tag usually doesn't add content to the page, if there is a space before and after
  //  a MathJax SCRIPT tag, IE will remove the first space.  When MathJax inserts
  //  the typeset mathematics, this means there will be no space before it and the
  //  preceding text.  In order to avoid this, you should include some "guard characters"
  //  before or after the math SCRIPT tag; define the patterns you want to use below.
  //  Note that these are used as regular expressions, so you will need to quote
  //  special characters.  Furthermore, since they are javascript strings, you must
  //  quote javascript special characters as well.  So to obtain a backslash, you must
  //  use \\ (doubled for javascript).  For example, "\\[" is the pattern \[ in the
  //  regular expression.  That means that if you want an actual backslash in your
  //  guard characters, you need to use "\\\\" in order to get \\ in the regular
  //  expression, and \ in the actual text.  If both preJax and postJax are defined,
  //  both must be present in order to be  removed.
  //
  //  See also the preRemoveClass comments below.
  //  
  //  Example:
  //      preJax: "\\\\\\\\",  // makes a double backslash the preJax text
  //    or
  //      preJax:  "\\[\\[", // jax scripts must be enclosed in double brackets
  //      postJax: "\\]\\]",
  //
  preJax: null,
  postJax: null,
  
  //
  //  The CSS class for a math preview to be removed preceding a MathJax
  //  SCRIPT tag.  If the tag just before the MathJax SCRIPT tag is of this
  //  class, its contents are removed when MathJax processes the SCRIPT
  //  tag.  This allows you to include a math preview in a form that will
  //  be displayed prior to MathJax performing its typesetting.  It also
  //  avoids the Internet Explorer space-removal bug, and can be used in
  //  place of preJax and postJax if that is more convenient.
  //  
  //  For example
  //  
  //      <span class="MathJax_Preview">[math]</span><script type="math/tex">...</script>
  //
  //  would display "[math]" in place of the math until MathJax is able to typeset it.

  //
  //  This value controls the verbosity of the messages in the lower left-hand corner.
  //  Set it to "none" to eliminate all messages, or set it to "simple" to show
  //  "Loading..." and "Processing..." rather than showing the full file name and the
  //  percentage of the mathematics processed.
  //
  messageStyle: "normal",
  
  //
  //  These two parameters control the alignment and shifting of displayed equations.
  //  The first can be "left", "center", or "right", and determines the alignment of
  //  displayed equations.  When the alignment is not "center", the second determines
  //  an indentation from the left or right side for the displayed equations.  When
