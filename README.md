Scope of the Project
--------------------

draw.io is a diagramming or whiteboarding application, depending on which theme is selected. It is not an SVG editing app, the SVG export is designed only for embedding in web pages, not for further editing in other tools.

The application is designed to be used largely as-is. draw.io is not suitable as a framework for building other products from. For this try either [Tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) or [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).

If you are using a draw.io project/product and have issues or questions about the editor itself, the issue tracker and discussion in this GitHub project are likely a good place to look.

Running
-------

One way to run draw.io is to fork this project, [publish the master branch to GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) and the [pages sites](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio/src/main/webapp/index.html) will have the full editor functionality (sans the integrations).

Another way is to use [the recommended Docker project](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio) or to download [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net).

The full packaged .war of the client and servlets is built when the project is tagged and available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases).

Supported Browsers
------------------

draw.io supports Chrome 70+, Firefox 70+, Safari 11+, Opera 50+, Native Android browser 7x+, the default browser in the current and previous major iOS versions (e.g. 11.2.x and 10.3.x) and Edge 79+.

This project is not open-source, nor open-contribution
------------------------------------------------------

draw.io is not open source software. The complete source code required to build the app from scratch is not available. The Apache license allows you to deploy the project and make changes to the source code that is available on the site.

We do not make full human readable sources available to avoid a position where another commercial product affects our revenues.

draw.io is not suitable as a framework for building other products from. For this try either [Tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) or [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).

draw.io is also closed to contributions. We follow a development process compliant with our SOC 2 Type II process. We do not have a mechanism where we can accept contributions from non-staff members.
